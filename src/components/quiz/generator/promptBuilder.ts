    # üéÆ Interactive Education Game Generator ‚Äì All-in-One HTML File

    ## üéØ Objective
    Generate a fully self-contained interactive educational game based on the topic: "${topic}".

    ---

    ## ‚úÖ Core Requirements
    - All in **one HTML file** (HTML, CSS, JS inline)
    - **No external libraries**, only **Vanilla JavaScript**
    - Responsive layout (works on desktop & mobile)
    - Valid HTML5 structure
    - JavaScript must run after \`DOMContentLoaded\`
    - Use \`try-catch\` and validate all inputs
    - **Include a timer** for the game (both per question and total game time)
    - **Track player score** and provide final results

    ---

    ## üéì Game Logic
    - Consider multiple formats: quiz, flashcards, matching, memory, ordering, word search, etc.
    - Provide clear instructions to players
    - Implement proper time management (countdown timers)
    - Show **instant feedback** (right/wrong + highlight correct)
    - Track score and display final result with a performance message
    - Allow players to restart the game

    ${gameSpecificInstructions}

    ## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Management Requirements
    - Include per-question timer where appropriate (e.g., quiz, pictionary)
    - Include total game timer for all games
    - Add time settings in the JSON output:
      \`\`\`json
      "settings": {
        "timePerQuestion": 30,
        "totalTime": 300,
        "timeLimit": 180,
        "bonusTimePerCorrect": 5
      }
      \`\`\`
    - Adjust timer difficulty based on game type and settings
    - Show remaining time visually to the player

    ---

    ## üñºÔ∏è Image Instructions (CRITICAL)
    - NEVER include actual image URLs in your response
    - For games requiring images (like Pictionary), ONLY provide specific search terms for each item
    - DO NOT use 'imageUrl' in your JSON - instead use 'imageSearchTerm'
    - Example format for image questions:
      \`\`\`json
      {
        "imageSearchTerm": "red apple fruit detailed",
        "answer": "Apple",
        "options": ["Banana", "Apple", "Orange", "Grape"],
        "hint": "Keeps the doctor away"
      }
      \`\`\`
    - Make search terms very specific (e.g., "red apple fruit" not just "apple")
    - Our system will handle all image fetching from Pixabay API using your search terms
    - Search terms should be in English for best results, even for non-English games

    ${imageInstructions}

    ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid
    - Don't use broken or undefined variables
    - Ensure all event listeners are properly attached
    - Avoid unnecessary DOM manipulation or deeply nested loops
    - Prevent layout overflow or broken UI on small screens
    - Always handle errors with \`try-catch\`
    - Escape all special characters properly in JSON output
    - NEVER include actual image URLs in your response
    - Don't forget to implement both per-question and total game timers

    ${settingsPrompt}

    ---

    ## üì§ Output Format
    Return a **valid JSON object**:

    \`\`\`json
    {
      "title": "Game Title",
      "description": "Short game description",
      "content": "A full, escaped HTML document string (\\\\", \\\\\\\\ escaped properly)"
    }
    \`\`\`
  `;
};
