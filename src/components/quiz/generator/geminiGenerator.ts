Create a high-quality matching pairs game about "${topic}" with the following specifications:

1. Structure:
   - Create exactly 8-10 pairs of matching concepts
   - Left side and right side items must clearly relate to each other
   - For ${difficulty} difficulty: ${difficulty === 'easy' ? 'use simple, direct pairs that are easy to match' : difficulty === 'medium' ? 'include some pairs that require more thought but are still clearly related' : 'create challenging pairs that require deeper knowledge'}

2. Layout:
   - Words must be arranged in a way that's suitable for a grid layout
   - Ensure all words fit comfortably on screen without wrapping
   - For longer words, provide shorter alternatives or break complex concepts into simpler terms

3. Display Requirements:
   - Maximum character length per item: ${difficulty === 'easy' ? '15' : difficulty === 'medium' ? '20' : '25'} characters
   - Items should be properly spaced and aligned
   - No special characters that could cause display issues

4. Game Mechanics:
   - Time limit: ${timeLimit} seconds
   - Difficulty progression: Items get gradually more challenging
   - Scoring system: 10 points per correct match, -5 points for incorrect tries

JSON Format Example:
{
  "title": "Matching Game: ${topic}",
  "description": "Match related concepts about ${topic}",
  "pairs": [
    {"left": "Term 1", "right": "Definition 1"},
    {"left": "Term 2", "right": "Definition 2"}
  ],
  "settings": {
    "timeLimit": ${timeLimit},
    "shuffleItems": true,
    "difficulty": "${difficulty}"
  }
}

Make sure each item is unique, with no duplicate items in either column. Return ONLY valid JSON without additional text.

    case 'wordsearch':

Create a word search puzzle about "${topic}" with the following specifications:

1. Grid:
   - Size: ${difficulty === 'easy' ? '8x8' : difficulty === 'medium' ? '10x10' : '12x12'} letters
   - Words placed in horizontal and vertical directions only for ${difficulty === 'easy' ? 'easy difficulty' : 'better readability'}
   - ${difficulty !== 'easy' ? 'Include diagonal word placements for added challenge' : ''}
   - Ensure letters are properly spaced and aligned

2. Words:
   - Include ${difficulty === 'easy' ? '5-7' : difficulty === 'medium' ? '8-10' : '10-12'} words related to "${topic}"
   - Word length: ${difficulty === 'easy' ? '3-5' : difficulty === 'medium' ? '4-7' : '5-10'} letters
   - No special characters or spaces in words
   - Words should be meaningful and educational related to the topic

3. Difficulty:
   - ${difficulty === 'easy' ? 'Words are placed in straightforward directions with minimal overlaps' : difficulty === 'medium' ? 'Some word overlaps and mixed directions' : 'Complex word arrangements with multiple overlaps and all possible directions'}
   - Fill remaining spaces with random letters that don't accidentally form other words

4. Game Mechanics:
   - Time limit: ${timeLimit * 10} seconds
   - Words are marked as found when correctly identified

JSON Format Example:
{
  "title": "Word Search: ${topic}",
  "description": "Find words related to ${topic} hidden in the grid",
  "words": [
    {"word": "EXAMPLE", "found": false},

  "settings": {
    "timeLimit": ${timeLimit * 10},

Ensure the grid actually contains all the words listed, properly placed. Return ONLY valid JSON without additional text.

   - For ${difficulty} difficulty: ${difficulty === 'easy' ? 'focus on basic facts and definitions' : difficulty === 'medium' ? 'include some analytical questions requiring deeper understanding' : 'create challenging questions that test thorough knowledge'}

2. Answer Options:
   - Each question must have exactly 4 options (A, B, C, D)
   - One clearly correct answer per question
   - Incorrect options should be plausible but clearly wrong when you know the material
   - No ambiguous or partially correct options

3. Difficulty Progression:
   - Questions should gradually increase in difficulty
   - First few questions should be accessible to beginners
   - ${difficulty !== 'easy' ? 'Later questions should challenge even knowledgeable players' : 'Keep all questions at an introductory level'}

4. Game Mechanics:
   - Time per question: ${timeLimit} seconds
   - Scoring: 10 points per correct answer, no points for incorrect answers
   - Provide brief explanations for correct answers to enhance learning

JSON Format Example:
{
  "title": "Quiz: ${topic}",

2. Format:
   - Keep front side concise (max 25 words)
   - Back side can be more detailed but still focused (max 50 words)
   - Add hints where appropriate to help with recall

3. Educational Value:
   - Cards should build on each other to create a comprehensive understanding
   - Include important facts, dates, concepts, formulas as appropriate for the topic
   - Ensure information is accurate and educational

4. Game Mechanics:
   - Auto-flip option after ${settings?.timePerQuestion || 5} seconds
